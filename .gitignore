# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
/.bundle

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*
!/log/.keep
/tmp

# Ignore dev SSL keys and certificates
/ssl

# Ignore frontend dependencies
/node_modules

# Ignore built files; these can be built in prod pipeline
/app/assets/javascripts/dist

# Ignore private file for local development environment variables
.env
